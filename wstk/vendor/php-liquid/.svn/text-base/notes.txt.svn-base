
# Implementation changes

The following changes were changed due to language differences between php and ruby

* All classes are prefixed with the word Liquid to prevent namespace issues

* The class method call "parse" to the LiquidTemplate object has been implemented as an
instance method

* The File system object is passed from the template object to the child classes, rather 
than being set in the LiquidTemplate object

* Certain tests (security_test, strainer_test) where not neccesary due to their not being 
any base object class in php and hence no corresponding security issues

* Instead of being registered via class methods, filters are registered to instances, and
a filterbank class replaces the strainer as the repository and invoker of filters
